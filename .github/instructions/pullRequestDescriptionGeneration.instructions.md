# Pull Request Title and Description Generation Instructions

When generating pull request titles and descriptions, please follow the format and guidelines defined in the project's `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file.

This ensures consistency and keeps PR content aligned with the latest team standards.

If you need guidance on what to include, typically the PR template covers:

- A concise title summarizing the change (under 50 characters).
- A description including problem, solution, and relevant context.
- A bullet-point list of key changes.
- Testing information.
- Links to related issues or documentation.
- Notes about breaking changes or follow-up actions.

Please always prioritize following the actual PR template content.
