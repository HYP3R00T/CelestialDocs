title: Site Search
---
By default, CelestialDocs sites include full-text search powered by [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/), which is a fast and low-bandwidth search tool for static sites.

No configuration is required to enable search. Build and deploy your site, then use the search bar in the site header to find content.

## Hide search icon

In `config.js`, you can disable the search function by keeping the value of `hide_search` as `true`.

```js
// config.js

export const docconfig = {
  ...
  hide_search: true,
  ...
};
```
