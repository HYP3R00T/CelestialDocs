By default, CelestialDocs sites include full-text search powered by [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/), which is a fast and low-bandwidth search tool for static sites.

No configuration is required to enable search. Build and deploy your site, then use the search bar in the site header to find content.

You can trigger search using keyboard shortcut also. Just press `ctrl` + `K`
</Callout>

## Hide search

In `config.js`, you can disable the search function by keeping the value of `hide_search` as `true`.

```js
// config.js

export const docconfig = {
  ...
  hide_search: true,
  ...
};
```
