# Notes

This is a quick reference collection for notes, tips, and snippets. Unlike the comprehensive documentation in `/docs`, this section is designed for short, focused entries.

## Getting Started

- Start by exploring the [Getting Started guide](getting-started)
- Check out [Usage Examples](usage) for common patterns
- Read [Tips & Tricks](tips-and-tricks) for best practices

## What Goes Here?

- Quick reference guides
- Code snippets and examples
- Short how-to instructions
- Project-specific notes
- Troubleshooting tips

## Structure

Each note should be a focused, self-contained entry. Use `navLabel` in frontmatter to customize how it appears in navigation, or `navHidden: true` to hide private notes.

**Tip**: Create subdirectories to organize notes by topic (e.g., `notes/typescript/`, `notes/deployment/`) for better organization as your collection grows.
