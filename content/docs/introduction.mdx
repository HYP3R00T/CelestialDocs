CelestialDocs is a modern documentation template built on [Astro](https://astro.build) that transforms how you structure and present documentation. It's designed for teams and individuals who need sophisticated navigation without complexity.

## What Makes CelestialDocs Special?

This documentation system is built on three core innovations:

### 🎯 Hierarchical Navigation

A three-tier system that scales from simple to enterprise-grade structures: **Entries** (individual pages) organize into **Groups** (collections), which can contain **Nested Groups** for deep hierarchies, and any Group can become a **Tab** for complete navigation context switching.

### 🔄 Hybrid Generation

Tired of choosing between convenience and control? Use auto-generation to discover files automatically, manual curation to pin important pages first, or hybrid mode to get both. Your documentation grows without constant configuration updates.

### 📚 True Multi-Collection Support

Run multiple independent documentation systems from one codebase. Each collection has its own folder, routes, navigation structure, and configuration. Perfect for documenting multiple products or separating user guides from API references.

## This Documentation

This docs collection is specifically designed to showcase CelestialDocs' capabilities through practical examples. Every feature mentioned here is demonstrated through the site's own navigation structure:

- **Foundation**: Essential concepts explained clearly
- **Getting Started**: Set up your first collection
