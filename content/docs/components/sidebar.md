The Sidebar organizes your docs into top-level tabs, groups, and entries. It's designed to be readable, keyboard-accessible, and low-maintenance: use `autoGenerated` for most groups and add manual `entries` when you need to pin or curate pages.

## How it behaves

- Tabs: top-level groups from `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION` usually become tabs when there are multiple visible groups.
- Groups: can contain `entries` (manual items) and nested `groups`. When `autoGenerated: true`, the group's folder contents (`content/docs/<group>`) are automatically appended as entries.
- Entries: link to individual documentation pages. The current page is highlighted using `aria-current="page"`.
- Expand/collapse: group headers are buttons that expand or collapse their child list. Groups that contain the current page are expanded automatically on page load.

## Accessibility & Keyboard

- Group toggles are implemented as `<button>` elements with `aria-expanded` and an animated chevron indicator for visual affordance.
- The script ensures keyboard users can tab to group toggles and use Enter/Space to open/close groups.
- Make sure headings and links within your content use semantic HTML so screen readers can build a meaningful reading order.

## Icons and labels

- Use `navIcon` frontmatter on pages to show a small icon beside the entry; an emoji works immediately (e.g., `navIcon: "📚"`).
- To use a custom SVG icon, add `<name>.svg` to `src/assets/icons/` and set `navIcon: "<name>"`. The system falls back to a default document icon if the file is missing.
- Use `navLabel` frontmatter to override how a page is labeled in the sidebar (shorter labels are better for readability).

## Controlling visibility and order

- To hide a page from the sidebar while keeping it accessible, set `navHidden: true` in the page frontmatter.
- Use the `hidden` flag on a manual `entries` item in `data/config.ts` to hide that configured entry.
- `navOrder` in frontmatter controls ordering for auto-generated entries (lower numbers sort first). Manual `entries` are shown in the configured order followed by auto-generated entries.

## Responsive behavior

- On large screens the sidebar is shown as a left column (280px wide by default). On small screens it is hidden by default and can be toggled open (see the header mobile menu).
- When mobile, the sidebar slides in from the left and can be dismissed by closing the menu or navigating to a page.

## Code snippets & examples

**Basic auto-generated group**

```ts
{
  id: 'guides',
  label: 'Guides',
  icon: 'book',
  autoGenerated: true,
}
```

**Pin pages at the top**

```ts
{
  id: 'getting-started',
  label: 'Getting Started',
  autoGenerated: true,
  entries: [
    { slug: 'getting-started/introduction' },
    { slug: 'getting-started/installation' },
  ],
}
```

**Hide an entry from the sidebar**

```yaml

```

## Implementation notes for contributors (short)

- The Sidebar's expand/collapse behavior is implemented in `src/components/docs/SidebarGroup.astro`. It includes a small script that initializes toggle listeners and prevents duplicate handlers.
- The active link is determined by comparing `currentSlug` to each entry's slug; active entries have `aria-current="page"` and a distinct visual style.

## Troubleshooting

- Page missing from sidebar: check `navHidden` in frontmatter, confirm file path, and ensure the slug matches the configured manual entry (if any).
- Manual entry warning: if you see warnings about a top-level entry not found, verify the slug in `data/config.ts` points to an existing page.
- Collapsing groups unexpectedly: groups are expanded automatically when the current page is inside them; if that's not desired, consider setting `hidden` on a manual entry or adjusting grouping.

If you'd like, I can add an annotated screenshot or small SVG diagram showing the sidebar anatomy and how pages map to groups.
