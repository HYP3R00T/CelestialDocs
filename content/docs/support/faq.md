This FAQ collects common questions from content authors and site maintainers with quick, actionable answers.

## Pages & Navigation

**Q: My page doesn't show in the sidebar — what should I check?**
- A:
  1. Confirm the file exists under `content/docs/` and the slug matches (path + filename without extension).
  2. Ensure the page frontmatter includes `title` (required). Other fields like `pubDatetime` are optional.
  3. Verify `navHidden` is not set to `true` in the frontmatter.
  4. If the group uses manual `entries` in `data/config.ts`, ensure the slug is listed or that `autoGenerated` is enabled for the group.

**Q: How can I pin a page at the top of a group?**
- A: Add a manual entry to the group's `entries` array in `data/config.ts` (e.g., `{ slug: 'guides/my-guide', label: 'Quick Guide' }`).

**Q: How do I hide a page from the sidebar but keep it accessible?**
- A: Set `navHidden: true` in the page frontmatter. The page remains reachable via its URL but won't appear in the sidebar.


## Content Authoring

**Q: When should I use `.md` vs `.mdx`?**
- A:
  - Use `.md` (plain Markdown) for most pages — it's simpler and safer for non-developers.
  - Use `.mdx` only when you need to embed React components or advanced interactivity; MDX is intended for power users.

**Q: What frontmatter is required?**
- A: `title` is required by the `docs` collection schema. Other fields (`description`, `tags`, `navLabel`, `pubDatetime`, etc.) are optional but useful.

**Q: How do I add images or covers?**
- A: Place images in `public/images/` and reference them in frontmatter with absolute paths (e.g., `cover: '/images/guides/cover.jpg'`); use `coverAlt` for alt text.


## Source Button & Drafts

**Q: How does the "View as Markdown" button work?**
- A: The button opens `/docs/<slug>.md` (implemented in `src/pages/docs/[...slug].md.ts`), which serves the `.mdx` or `.md` source file for viewing or download.

**Q: Are drafts protected from being viewed via the source button?**
- A: Not by default — a page with `draft: true` is still served if the file exists. If you need to prevent access to drafts, either keep them in a private branch or add draft filtering to the server route (we can implement that for you).


## Table of Contents

**Q: Why don't I see a TOC on my page?**
- A: The TOC shows only H2 and H3 headings. Ensure your content uses H2/H3 headings (not only H1) and that there are at least one or two headings to show.


## Local dev & build

**Q: How do I preview changes locally?**
- A: Fork and clone the repo, then run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Make changes to `content/docs/` and the site will reload automatically. If navigation or config changes don't appear, try restarting the dev server.

**Q: My manual `entries` in `data/config.ts` show a warning — what's wrong?**
- A: A warning means a configured slug doesn't match any discovered page. Check file paths and correct the slug or add the missing page.


## Deployment & CI

**Q: What commands do I use for production builds?**
- A:
  - `pnpm build` — build the site for production.
  - `pnpm preview` — run a local preview of the built site.

**Q: Should I filter drafts in CI?**
- A: Yes — enforce draft rules in your CI or publishing workflow if you don't want `draft: true` pages to be publicly served. You can implement a simple check that prevents deployment if drafts exist on the main branch.


## Troubleshooting & Support

**Q: Where do I report a bug or request a feature?**
- A: Open an issue in the repository: `https://github.com/HYP3R00T/CelestialDocs/issues`.

**Q: I need help with custom behavior (e.g., change sidebar logic) — can you help?**
- A: Yes — for developer-level changes see the *Developer* docs (`developer/navigation-api.md`, `developer/content-collections.md`). If you want, I can draft an example patch or tests for the change.


If you'd like, I can add short screenshots or a GIF for the most common troubleshooting items (e.g., verifying `navHidden` or fixing a slug mismatch).
