## Welcome to CelestialDocs!

CelestialDocs is a **documentation template** built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) that makes it easy to create and maintain documentation sites - without needing to be a developer.

### What makes it special?

**For Content Authors:**
- Write documentation in simple Markdown files (`.md`)
- No complicated setup or build process
- Organize content exactly how you want
- Use emojis and custom icons in your sidebar

**For Developers:**
- Built with modern tools (Astro, React, Tailwind CSS)
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- MDX support for interactive components
- Customizable configuration

### How it works (simple version)

1. **You write files** in the `content/docs/` folder
2. **The site discovers them** automatically
3. **Sidebar navigation** is configured in one place (`data/config.ts`)
4. **Your documentation is live** - just commit and push

### Who is this for?

- Product teams documenting features
- Open source maintainers with complex docs
- Developers who want a professional docs site without complexity
- Anyone forking this template for their own project

### What's inside?

- 📁 **Filesystem-driven content**: Add `.md` or `.mdx` files, they become pages
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Dark mode, responsive design, Tailwind CSS
- 🧭 **Smart navigation**: Sidebar with groups, tabs, and auto-generation
- ⚙️ **Flexible config**: One config file controls almost everything
- 🔗 **Multiple collections**: Support docs, notes, or any content type
- 🎭 **MDX support**: Embed React components in markdown
