Welcome to **CelestialDocs** — a lightweight documentation template built with Astro and Shadcn, made for content authors and non-developer contributors who want to write documentation without worrying about tooling.

What you'll get:

- A filesystem-driven docs site: add Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files under `content/docs/` and they become pages.
- A configurable sidebar: control groups, ordering, and labels from `data/config.ts` without touching the code.
- User-friendly helpers such as a "View as Markdown" source button, a Table of Contents panel, and simple theme/layout toggles.

Who this guide is for:

- Content writers and product people who want to author and maintain docs with minimal setup.
- People who will fork this repo, edit content in `content/` and configuration in `data/`, and submit pull requests.

Focus areas for end users:

- content/docs/ — Put your documentation files here (this is where you author pages).
- data/config.ts — Customize the sidebar, site metadata, and TOC behavior (only change what you need).

Next steps: see the Installation page for the recommended workflow (fork → clone → run), then follow the Quick Start to add your first page.
