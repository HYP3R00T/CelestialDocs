Welcome! We're excited you're here. CelestialDocs is a modern documentation template built with [Astro](https://astro.build) that makes creating beautiful, organized documentation a breeze.

## What is CelestialDocs?

CelestialDocs is a flexible documentation template designed to help you create professional documentation sites quickly. It combines the power of Astro's static site generation with an intuitive navigation system that scales from simple single-page docs to complex multi-collection documentation sites.

Think of it as your documentation's best friend - it handles the structure, navigation, and styling so you can focus on writing great content.

## Why Choose CelestialDocs?

### 🎯 Flexible Navigation

CelestialDocs offers multiple ways to organize your content:

- **Groups** - Organize related pages together in the sidebar
- **Tabs** - Create distinct sections for different topics
- **Auto-generation** - Let the system discover and organize files automatically
- **Manual control** - Explicitly order pages when you need precise control

Mix and match these approaches to create the perfect structure for your documentation.

### 📚 Multi-Collection Support

Need more than one documentation site? CelestialDocs supports multiple content collections out of the box. Create separate documentation sets with different tones, structures, and purposes - all in one project.

Perfect for:

- Main documentation + API reference
- User guides + developer docs
- Serious documentation + fun examples (like our funnydocs!)

### ✨ Beautiful by Default

CelestialDocs comes with:

- **Dark mode** - Automatic theme switching for comfortable reading
- **Responsive design** - Looks great on all devices
- **Table of contents** - Auto-generated navigation for long pages
- **Breadcrumbs** - Always know where you are
- **Search** - Find what you need quickly (coming soon!)

### 🚀 Built with Modern Tools

- **Astro** - Fast, modern static site generator
- **Markdown & MDX** - Write in familiar formats, use components when needed
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe configuration
- **Tailwind CSS** - Easy customization

### 🎨 Customizable

While CelestialDocs looks great out of the box, everything is customizable:

- Add your own branding and colors
- Create custom MDX components
- Adjust layouts and spacing
- Use emoji or SVG icons for navigation

## Who is CelestialDocs For?

CelestialDocs is perfect for:

- **Open source projects** needing documentation sites
- **Product teams** creating user guides and API docs
- **Technical writers** who want a flexible, maintainable system
- **Developers** who want to focus on content, not infrastructure

## What Makes It Different?

Unlike other documentation tools, CelestialDocs gives you:

1. **True multi-collection support** - Not just multiple sections, but completely separate documentation sites in one project
2. **Flexible navigation** - Mix manual and auto-generated navigation in the same sidebar
3. **Tab-level organization** - Create distinct navigation contexts without overwhelming users
4. **Simple configuration** - Everything is configured in one TypeScript file with full type safety
