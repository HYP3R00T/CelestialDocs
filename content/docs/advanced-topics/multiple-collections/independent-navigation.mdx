title: "Independent Navigation Per Collection"
description: "Understand how each collection maintains its own navigation structure independently"
---

Each collection in CelestialDocs is completely independent. They don't affect each other—different navigation structures, different configurations, different rules.

## Independence Model

```
Collection 1: docs          Collection 2: api
├── Route: /docs            ├── Route: /api
├── Navigation: Tabs        ├── Navigation: Nested groups
├── Auto-gen: Yes           ├── Auto-gen: No
└── Style: Simple           └── Style: Complex
```

Each collection:
- Has its own folder
- Has its own route prefix
- Has its own sidebar navigation config
- Can use different generation strategies
- Can have different structures
- Can have different numbers of tabs/groups

## Configuration Example

```typescript
export const SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION = {
    // Collection 1: Simple auto-generated
    docs: {
        defaultTab: { label: "Learn", icon: "📖" },
        groups: [
            { id: "guides", label: "Guides", autoGenerated: true },
            { id: "api", label: "API", autoGenerated: true },
        ],
    },

    // Collection 2: Complex with tabs and nesting
    platform: {
        defaultTab: { label: "Getting Started", icon: "🚀" },
        groups: [
            {
                id: "user-guide",
                label: "User Guide",
                tab: true,
                groups: [
                    { id: "basics", label: "Basics", autoGenerated: true },
                    {
                        id: "advanced",
                        label: "Advanced",
                        groups: [
                            { id: "performance", label: "Performance", autoGenerated: true },
                            { id: "security", label: "Security", autoGenerated: true },
                        ],
                    },
                ],
            },
            {
                id: "api",
                label: "API Reference",
                tab: true,
                entries: [
                    { slug: "api/endpoints" },
                    { slug: "api/authentication" },
                ],
            },
        ],
    },
};
```

**Collection 1 (docs):**
- Simple two-group structure
- Fully auto-generated
- No tabs

**Collection 2 (platform):**
- Complex with 2 tabs
- Nested groups
- Mix of auto and manual

Same codebase, completely different structures!

## Navigation Context Switching

Tabs only exist within their collection. Switching tabs within `/docs/*` won't affect `/api/*` navigation.

```
User on: /docs/guides/installation
Tabs available: (none - docs collection has no tabs)

User on: /api/v2/endpoints
Tabs available: [v1 Legacy] [v2 Current] [v3 Beta]
(Only for api collection)
```

## Independent File Organization

Files are organized per collection, matching the navigation structure:

```
content/
├── docs/                    (Collection: docs)
│   ├── guides/
│   │   ├── intro.md
│   │   ├── setup.md
│   │   └── advanced.md
│   └── api/
│       ├── overview.md
│       └── reference.md
│
├── platform/                (Collection: platform)
│   ├── getting-started/
│   │   ├── setup.md
│   │   └── first-app.md
│   ├── user-guide/
│   │   ├── basics/
│   │   └── advanced/
│   │       ├── performance/
│   │       └── security/
│   └── api/
│       ├── endpoints/
│       ├── authentication.md
│       └── webhooks.md
```

No interaction between collections—each maintains its own structure.

## Configuration Independence

Each collection has independent settings:

### Docs Collection (Auto-Discovery)
```typescript
groups: [
    { id: "guides", label: "Guides", autoGenerated: true }
]
```
New files appear automatically.

### Platform Collection (Manual Control)
```typescript
groups: [
    {
        id: "endpoints",
        label: "Endpoints",
        entries: [
            { slug: "api/endpoints/users" },
            { slug: "api/endpoints/posts" },
        ],
    }
]
```
Only listed entries appear.

Same system, different strategies.

## Breadcrumb Separation

Breadcrumbs are collection-specific:

```
docs collection:
Home > Docs > Guides > Installation

platform collection:
Home > Platform > User Guide > Basics > Setup
```

Users understand they're in different documentation systems.
