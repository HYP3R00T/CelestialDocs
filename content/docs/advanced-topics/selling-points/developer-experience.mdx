CelestialDocs focuses on speed and confidence for both authors and maintainers.

## Fast Authoring
- **Hot reload** via `astro dev` keeps feedback tight.
- **Auto-generated nav** means new pages appear without config edits when you want them to.
- **MDX support** lets teams reuse UI components without custom embeds.

## Safe Changes
- **Zod validation** blocks builds when required frontmatter is missing.
- **Typed navigation config** prevents broken links from malformed slugs.
- **Draft + navHidden** controls keep unfinished work out of production.

## Maintainable UI
- **Shared design system** components (buttons, navigation menu, breadcrumbs) ship with sensible defaults.
- **Tailwind + Prettier** ensure consistent styling without hand-tuning class order.
- **Icons and badges** stay centralized in `src/assets/icons` for predictable theming.

## Team Practices
- Keep navigation small and purposeful; split groups instead of overloading one tab.
- Encourage authors to start with Markdown, adding MDX only for true interactivity.
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` in CI so validation protects main.

## Next Steps
- Learn why strict types matter in [Type Safety](/docs/advanced-topics/selling-points/type-safety)
- Review hybrid navigation options in [Hybrid Approach Patterns](/docs/generation-strategies/hybrid-approach/real-world-patterns)
