This site builds its documentation navigation from the files under `content/docs/` and from the `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION` object in `data/config.ts`. The system blends filesystem discovery with optional manual overrides so content authors can work mostly in files while admins or maintainers can curate the sidebar.

How it works (high level):

1. Discovery: the docs collection is defined in `src/content.config.ts`. The build process uses the Astro content API (`getCollection('docs')`) to list all pages and their frontmatter.
2. Filesystem structure: pages are grouped by their directory path (for example, `content/docs/getting-started/*` maps to the `getting-started` group by default).
3. Sidebar configuration: `data/config.ts` exports `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION`. Groups and entries in that object allow you to pin pages, create nested groups, override labels, and decide whether a group should auto-generate entries from the filesystem.
4. Build step: the navigation builder (`src/lib/navigation/*`) merges manual config with auto-discovered pages, applying rules for hidden pages, ordering, and group processing.

Key behaviors for content authors:

- Auto-discovery: if a group has `autoGenerated: true`, any pages in the group's folder will be appended automatically.
- Manual entries: add an `entries` item in `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION` to pin a page to the top of a group or give it a custom label.
- Hidden pages: set `navHidden: true` in a page's frontmatter to keep it accessible by URL but remove it from the sidebar.
- Ordering: when manual and auto entries are mixed, use `navOrder` (frontmatter) to influence ordering for auto-generated pages.

Where to make changes:

- For most content changes (write/edit pages): update files in `content/docs/` and add appropriate frontmatter.
- For navigation structure (groups, pinned entries, top-level ordering): edit `data/config.ts` (`SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION`). This is the place to create curated or branded navigation experiences.

Debugging & tips:

- If a page is missing from the sidebar: check `navHidden` in its frontmatter, and verify the slug matches the file path (no file extension in slug).
- If a configured slug is not found, the navigation builder will warn in the console: verify the file exists and the path is correct.
- Use the `debug/navigation.json.ts` page (if present) or add a temporary API route to print the results of the navigation builder for inspection.
- If you want a different default landing page for `/docs`, update `SITE.defaultDocRedirect` in `data/config.ts`.

Examples & common patterns:

- Curated group with two pinned pages but otherwise automatic:

```ts
{
  id: 'getting-started',
  label: 'Getting Started',
  autoGenerated: true,
  entries: [
    { slug: 'getting-started/introduction' },
    { slug: 'getting-started/installation' },
  ],
}
```

- A fully manual group (no auto-generation):

```ts
{
  id: 'tutorials',
  label: 'Tutorials',
  autoGenerated: false,
  entries: [
    { slug: 'tutorials/start' },
    { slug: 'tutorials/advanced' }
  ],
}
```

If you'd like, I can add visual diagrams showing how files map to groups, or add a debug snippet that outputs the navigation JSON for easier inspection.
