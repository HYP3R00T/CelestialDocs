The sidebar UI can present multiple **tabs** (top-level group tabs) and a **default** or root area that aggregates default children and root-level entries. Understanding how tabs are derived helps you design a predictable navigation structure.

How tabs are built (user-facing explanation):

- The builder examines the configured top-level groups (from `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION`). Each top-level group typically becomes a tab.
- A **default** area is assembled from configured default children (ordered entries and groups that act as an initial landing area) plus root entries discovered from the filesystem.
- Tabs are shown only when there are two or more visible tabs. When a single tab exists, the UI shows the content for that tab without a separate tab bar (this keeps the layout simple for small doc sets).

Key user controls:

- Create multiple top-level groups to produce multiple tabs (e.g., `getting-started`, `guides`, `reference`).
- Use `entries` on a top-level group to curate items shown at the top of that tab.
- The **default** tab is useful for surfacing an ordered set of core pages (for example, an overview or getting-started collection) before users switch to other tabs.

Examples

1) Two tabs (Getting Started and Guides)

```ts
groups: [
  { id: 'getting-started', label: 'Getting Started', autoGenerated: true },
  { id: 'guides', label: 'Guides', autoGenerated: true }
]
```

This configuration will show a tab bar with "Getting Started" and "Guides".

2) Default area + a tab

If you add a default area (via configured default children or root entries), the site may create a default tab along with group tabs. For example, a set of curated default entries will appear in the default tab.

Troubleshooting & notes

- If you expect tabs but don't see a tab bar, check whether the default tab is the only visible tab — the UI hides the tab bar when only a single tab exists.
- The active tab is chosen based on the current page slug — ensure your page slugs match the configured entries or directory paths.
- If you want to force multiple tabs for visual reasons, create a second top-level group (even if it's small) instead of relying on only auto-generated children.

If you'd like, I can add a short diagram showing the relationship between top-level groups, default area, and tabs for clearer visualization.
