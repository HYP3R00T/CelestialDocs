Use navigation overrides when the default title-based sidebar is not enough.

## Override the Label

Shorten long titles without changing the page heading.

```yaml
---
title: "Implementing OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow"
navLabel: "OAuth 2.0"
---
```

## Add or Remove Icons

```yaml
---
navIcon: "🔒"   # Emoji
# or
navIcon: "lock" # Icon name from your icon set
---
```

## Hide from Navigation

Keep a page accessible but remove it from the sidebar.

```yaml
---
navHidden: true
---
```

Pair with `draft: true` for work-in-progress pages so they are skipped in production builds.

## Hide Breadcrumbs

For landing pages that should feel standalone.

```yaml
---
hide_breadcrumbs: true
---
```

## Guidelines

- Use overrides sparingly—consistent labels aid recognition.
- Avoid overloading icons; pick a small, consistent set.
- Do not hide critical paths; use `navHidden` only when you have alternative entry points.
- Keep overrides in sync with the navigation config so users do not see conflicting labels.

## Next Steps

- Review the base metadata in [Required Frontmatter Fields](/docs/content/frontmatter/required-fields)
- See other optional metadata in [Optional Frontmatter Fields](/docs/content/frontmatter/optional-fields)
