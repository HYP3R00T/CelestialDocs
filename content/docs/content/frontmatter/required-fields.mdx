title: "Required Frontmatter Fields"
description: "The must-have metadata every page needs"
---

All docs must include two fields. Without them, content validation fails and builds break.

## title
- Shown in the sidebar (unless overridden)
- Appears in the browser tab and SEO metadata
- Keep it concise (3–6 words)

```yaml
---
title: "Create Your First Page"
---
```

## description
- Short summary for search engines and previews
- Aim for 120–160 characters
- Mention the outcome or audience

```yaml
---
description: "Create and publish your first page in CelestialDocs with validated metadata."
---
```

## Quality Guidelines

Ensure your frontmatter follows these best practices:
- Title is unique within the section
- Description is actionable and under ~160 characters
- No trailing punctuation in the title
- Tone matches the rest of the docs

## Next Steps
- Add optional metadata in [Optional Frontmatter Fields](/docs/content/frontmatter/optional-fields)
- Control labels and visibility in [Navigation Overrides](/docs/content/frontmatter/navigation-overrides)
