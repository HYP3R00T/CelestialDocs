Frontmatter is YAML metadata at the top of every page. It controls page display and navigation behavior.

## Required Fields

Every page must have these:

### title

Page title that appears in browser tab and sidebar.

```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started"
---
```

### description

Short description for SEO and preview text.

```yaml
---
description: "Learn how to get started with CelestialDocs in 5 minutes"
---
```

## Optional Navigation Fields

### navLabel

Override the sidebar label (if different from title).

```yaml
---
title: "Installation and Configuration"
navLabel: "Install"  <- Sidebar shows this instead
---
```

### navIcon

Add an icon in the sidebar next to the entry.

```yaml
---
navIcon: "⚡"  <- Emoji
---
```

or

```yaml
---
navIcon: "document"  <- SVG reference
---
```

### navHidden

Hide from navigation but keep accessible via URL.

```yaml
---
navHidden: true
---
```

Page won't appear in sidebar but users can still visit it directly.

## Optional Metadata Fields

### draft

Exclude from production builds.

```yaml
---
draft: true  <- Skipped in build
---
```

Useful for work-in-progress pages.

### authors

List page authors.

```yaml
---
authors: ["Alice", "Bob"]
---
```

### tags

Categorize pages (useful for custom features).

```yaml
---
tags: ["tutorial", "beginner", "setup"]
---
```

## Complete Example

```yaml
---
title: "Advanced Configuration"
description: "Learn how to configure CelestialDocs for enterprise deployments"
navLabel: "Advanced Config"
navIcon: "⚙️"
navHidden: false
draft: false
authors: ["Alice", "Bob"]
tags: ["configuration", "advanced", "enterprise"]
---
# Advanced Configuration

## Common Patterns

### Tutorial Page

```yaml
---
title: "Building Your First App"
description: "Step-by-step guide to building your first application"
navLabel: "First App"
navIcon: "🚀"
authors: ["Your Name"]
tags: ["tutorial", "beginner"]
---
```

### Reference Page

```yaml
---
title: "API Endpoints Reference"
description: "Complete reference for all REST API endpoints"
navLabel: "Endpoints"
navIcon: "📡"
draft: false
tags: ["api", "reference"]
---
```

### Draft/WIP

```yaml
---
title: "Upcoming Features"
description: "Features we're working on"
draft: true
navHidden: true
---
```

### Hidden But Accessible

```yaml
---
title: "Internal Documentation"
description: "Internal team documentation"
navHidden: true
---
```

## Tips

1. **Keep titles short** (3-5 words)

    ```yaml
    title: "Getting Started"          ✅ Good
    title: "How to Get Started with CelestialDocs" ❌ Too long
    ```

2. **Use navLabel for long titles**

    ```yaml
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Deployment"
    navLabel: "Deployment FAQ"
    ```

3. **Use navHidden for drafts**

    ```yaml
    draft: true
    navHidden: true
    ```

4. **Add authors for accountability**

    ```yaml
    authors: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
    ```

5. **Use consistent icon style**
    ```yaml
    navIcon: "🚀"  # Emoji for visual variety
    navIcon: "book" # Or SVG for consistency
    ```
