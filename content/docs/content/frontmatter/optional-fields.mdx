title: "Optional Frontmatter Fields"
description: "Metadata that improves navigation, governance, and visibility"
---

Optional fields refine how pages appear and behave. Use them when they add clarity—skip them when they do not.

## navLabel

Shorten or rename the sidebar label without changing the title.

```yaml
---
title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Deployment"
navLabel: "Deployment FAQ"
---
```

## navIcon

Add visual affordance in the sidebar.

```yaml
---
navIcon: "🚀"   # Emoji
# or
navIcon: "book" # Icon name from your icon set
---
```

## navHidden

Hide the page from navigation while keeping the URL accessible (useful for drafts or landing pages).

```yaml
---
navHidden: true
---
```

## draft

Exclude the page from production builds.

```yaml
---
draft: true
---
```

## authors

Credit contributors or set ownership.

```yaml
---
authors: ["Alice", "Bob"]
---
```

## tags (custom)

If you extend the schema, tags help grouping or search.

```yaml
---
tags: ["api", "reference", "v2"]
---
```

## When to Use Optional Fields

- Use `navLabel` for long titles
- Use `navIcon` sparingly so the sidebar stays consistent
- Use `navHidden` + `draft` during in-flight work
- Add `authors` for high-ownership pages (SLAs, runbooks)

## Next Steps

- Enforce labels and visibility in [Navigation Overrides](/docs/content/frontmatter/navigation-overrides)
- Review mandatory fields in [Required Frontmatter Fields](/docs/content/frontmatter/required-fields)
