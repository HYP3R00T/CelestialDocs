title: "Components in MDX"
description: "Embed UI components safely inside your Markdown"

MDX supports JSX, so you can reuse the design system without creating separate pages.

## Import Once, Reuse Everywhere

```mdx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Separator } from "@/components/ui/separator";

## Call to action

Write your content, then drop in components:

<Button size="lg" variant="default">
    Get Started
</Button>
<Separator className="my-6" />
Supporting text stays Markdown and remains easy to edit.
```

## Recommended Components

- Buttons for primary calls-to-action
- Separators and `kbd` elements for quick highlights
- Navigation menus or breadcrumbs when explaining IA
- Custom callouts or alerts for warnings

## Best Practices

- Keep layout concerns in components, not in prose—avoid large custom `<div>` blocks.
- Use semantic components that render native HTML under the hood for accessibility.
- If a component needs hydration, keep it small and consider `client:visible`.
- Avoid passing un-sanitized user input into components rendered via MDX.

## Troubleshooting

- **Component not found?** Check the import path and file extension.
- **Styles missing?** Ensure the component relies on the shared Tailwind layer, not ad-hoc CSS inside the MDX file.
- **Unexpected spacing?** Wrap components in paragraphs or use utility classes to align with surrounding text.
