MDX lets you mix Markdown and JSX. You keep the readability of Markdown while adding interactive components where they add value.

## Why MDX

- Embed callouts, tabs, or code playgrounds inline.
- Reuse design-system components without leaving content files.
- Keep authors productive with Markdown syntax, only sprinkling JSX when necessary.

## Basic Example

You can render components directly inside your Markdown.

```mdx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

## Launch the product

Our quickstart covers the basics. Ready to go?

<Button size="lg">Launch</Button>
```

## Authoring Guidelines

- Keep JSX minimal; default to Markdown for normal prose.
- Prefer server-rendered components that do not require hydration.
- When hydration is required, scope it to a small island component and import that.
- Keep props small and explicit—avoid passing large objects through frontmatter.

## Shortcuts That Help Authors

- Extract reusable snippets into partial components so content stays clean.
- Use `navHidden: true` on draft MDX pages to avoid broken nav while iterating.
- Pair MDX with the hybrid navigation strategy so new pages appear automatically.
