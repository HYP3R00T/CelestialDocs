Running into issues? This guide covers common problems and their solutions. Most issues can be resolved quickly with these troubleshooting steps.

## Quick Fixes

Before diving into specific issues, try these quick fixes:

1. **Restart the dev server** - Stop (`Ctrl+C`) and restart (`npm run dev`)
2. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. **Check for errors** - Look at the terminal for error messages
4. **Run type check** - Execute `npm run check` to see TypeScript errors
5. **Update dependencies** - Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed

## Build Errors

### Build Fails with TypeScript Errors

**Symptoms:**

- Build fails with TypeScript errors
- Red error messages in terminal
- Errors mention `.ts` or `.astro` files

**Solutions:**

1. Run the type checker to see all errors:

```bash
npm run check
```

1. Common TypeScript issues:

**Missing frontmatter fields:**

```markdown
<!-- ❌ Missing description -->
---
title: "My Page"
---

<!-- ✅ Fixed -->
---
title: "My Page"
description: "Page description"
---
```

**Invalid configuration:**

```typescript
// ❌ Missing required field
{
  id: "guides",
  label: "Guides",
  // Missing icon
}

// ✅ Fixed
{
  id: "guides",
  label: "Guides",
  icon: "📖",
}
```

### Build Fails with "Cannot find module"

**Symptoms:**

- Error: `Cannot find module 'package-name'`
- Build fails immediately

**Solutions:**

1. Install missing dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

1. If that doesn't work, delete `node_modules` and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

1. Verify Node.js version:

```bash
node --version  # Should be 18 or higher
```

### Build Fails with "Out of Memory"

**Symptoms:**

- Error: `JavaScript heap out of memory`
- Build crashes during processing

**Solutions:**

1. Increase Node.js memory limit:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npm run build
```

1. Optimize images before committing (large images can cause memory issues)

2. Check for circular dependencies in your code

## Navigation Issues

### Pages Not Appearing in Sidebar

**Symptoms:**

- Created a new page but it doesn't show in navigation
- Page exists but sidebar is empty

**Solutions:**

1. **For auto-generated groups**, verify:
   - File is in the correct folder
   - File has valid frontmatter with a `title`
   - `autoGenerated: true` is set on the group
   - File doesn't have `navHidden: true`

2. **For manual groups**, verify:
   - Page is listed in `entries` array
   - Slug path is correct (no leading slash, no extension)
   - File exists at the specified path

3. Restart the dev server after adding new files

Example fix:

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong slug
{ slug: "/docs/guide.md" }

// ✅ Correct slug
{ slug: "docs/guide" }
```

### Navigation Shows Wrong Order

**Symptoms:**

- Pages appear in unexpected order
- Important pages are not at the top

**Solutions:**

1. **For manual groups**, check the order in your config:

```typescript
entries: [
  { slug: "guides/first" },   // Appears first
  { slug: "guides/second" },  // Appears second
  { slug: "guides/third" },   // Appears third
]
```

1. **For auto-generated groups**, use the `order` field in frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Important Page"
description: "Description"
order: 1  # Lower numbers appear first
---
```

1. **For hybrid groups**, remember:
   - Manual entries always appear first
   - Auto-generated entries follow, sorted by order or alphabetically

### Navigation Group Not Showing

**Symptoms:**

- Configured a group but it doesn't appear
- Sidebar is missing a section

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the group is in the correct collection:

```typescript
export const SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION = {
  docs: {  // Make sure you're editing the right collection
    groups: [
      // Your group here
    ],
  },
};
```

1. Check that the group has content:
   - Either `entries` array with valid slugs
   - Or `autoGenerated: true` with files in the folder

2. Verify folder name matches group ID:

```typescript
// Group ID
{ id: "guides" }

// Folder should be
content/docs/guides/
```

### Tab Navigation Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- Clicking a tab doesn't switch content
- Tab appears but is empty

**Solutions:**

1. Verify `tab: true` is set:

```typescript
{
  id: "api",
  label: "API Reference",
  icon: "📚",
  tab: true,  // Required for tabs
  autoGenerated: true,
}
```

1. Ensure the tab has content (entries or autoGenerated)

2. Check that tab ID is unique

3. Restart dev server after adding tabs

## Content Issues

### Frontmatter Errors

**Symptoms:**

- Error: `Invalid frontmatter`
- Build fails when processing content files

**Solutions:**

1. Verify YAML syntax is correct:

```markdown
<!-- ❌ Invalid YAML -->
---
title: "My Page
description: "Missing quote
---

<!-- ✅ Valid YAML -->
---
title: "My Page"
description: "Proper quotes"
---
```

1. Check for required fields:

```markdown
---
title: "My Page"        # Required
description: "Desc"     # Required
---
```

1. Validate YAML indentation (use spaces, not tabs):

```markdown
<!-- ❌ Wrong indentation -->
---
title: "Page"
  description: "Desc"
---

<!-- ✅ Correct indentation -->
---
title: "Page"
description: "Desc"
---
```

### Markdown Not Rendering Correctly

**Symptoms:**

- Markdown appears as plain text
- Formatting doesn't work
- Code blocks don't have syntax highlighting

**Solutions:**

1. Verify file extension is `.md` or `.mdx`

2. Check code block syntax:

````markdown
<!-- ❌ Missing language -->
```
const code = "here";
```

<!-- ✅ With language -->
```typescript
const code = "here";
```
````

1. Ensure proper heading hierarchy:

```markdown
# H1 - Page title
## H2 - Section
### H3 - Subsection
```

### Images Not Loading

**Symptoms:**

- Broken image icons
- Images don't appear
- 404 errors for images

**Solutions:**

1. **For optimized images** (recommended), use `src/assets/`:

```markdown
![Alt text](../../assets/image.png)
```

1. **For static images**, use `public/`:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/image.png)
```

1. Verify image path is correct relative to the file

2. Check that image file exists at the specified path

3. Ensure image file name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Links Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- Clicking links leads to 404
- Internal links broken
- External links don't open

**Solutions:**

1. **For internal links**, use relative or absolute paths:

```markdown
<!-- Relative -->
[Link](../other-page)

<!-- Absolute -->
[Link](/docs/other-page)
```

1. **For external links**, include full URL:

```markdown
[Link](https://example.com)
```

1. Verify target page exists

2. Check for typos in URLs

## Configuration Issues

### Changes Not Taking Effect

**Symptoms:**

- Modified `data/config.ts` but nothing changed
- New configuration not working

**Solutions:**

1. **Always restart the dev server** after config changes:

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

1. Clear browser cache with hard refresh

2. Check for syntax errors in config file:

```bash
npm run check
```

### Invalid Configuration

**Symptoms:**

- TypeScript errors in `data/config.ts`
- Build fails with config errors

**Solutions:**

1. Verify all required fields are present:

```typescript
// Required fields for groups
{
  id: "string",      // Required
  label: "string",   // Required
  icon: "string",    // Required
}
```

1. Check for typos in field names:

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong
{
  id: "guides",
  lable: "Guides",  // Typo: should be "label"
}

// ✅ Correct
{
  id: "guides",
  label: "Guides",
}
```

1. Ensure proper TypeScript types are used

### Icon Not Showing

**Symptoms:**

- Icon appears as text or doesn't show
- Broken icon in navigation

**Solutions:**

1. **For emoji icons**, use the actual emoji:

```typescript
icon: "🚀"  // ✅ Correct
icon: ":rocket:"  // ❌ Wrong (not supported)
```

1. **For SVG icons**, reference file without extension:

```typescript
icon: "document"  // ✅ Correct (references document.svg)
icon: "document.svg"  // ❌ Wrong (don't include extension)
```

1. Verify SVG file exists in `src/assets/icons/`

2. Check SVG file name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

## Development Server Issues

### Dev Server Won't Start

**Symptoms:**

- `npm run dev` fails
- Port already in use error
- Server crashes immediately

**Solutions:**

1. **Port already in use:**

```bash
# Kill process on port 4321
npx kill-port 4321

# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

1. **Missing dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

1. **Node version too old:**

```bash
node --version  # Should be 18+
```

### Hot Reload Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- Changes don't appear automatically
- Must manually refresh browser
- Dev server doesn't detect changes

**Solutions:**

1. Restart the dev server

2. Check that you're editing files in the correct directory

3. Some changes require manual refresh:
   - Configuration changes
   - New files added
   - Layout changes

4. Try hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Slow Dev Server

**Symptoms:**

- Dev server is very slow
- Pages take long to load
- Hot reload is delayed

**Solutions:**

1. Reduce number of files being watched

2. Optimize large images

3. Close other resource-intensive applications

4. Check for infinite loops in components

## Styling Issues

### Styles Not Applying

**Symptoms:**

- CSS changes don't appear
- Tailwind classes not working
- Custom styles ignored

**Solutions:**

1. **For Tailwind classes**, verify they're in the content config:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
content: ['./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}']
```

1. **For custom CSS**, ensure it's imported:

```astro
---
import '../styles/custom.css';
---
```

1. Check CSS specificity (more specific rules override general ones)

2. Clear browser cache

3. Restart dev server

### Dark Mode Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- Dark mode toggle doesn't work
- Styles don't change in dark mode
- Colors look wrong in dark mode

**Solutions:**

1. Verify `darkMode: 'class'` in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  // ...
}
```

1. Check that dark mode classes are defined:

```css
.dark .my-element {
  /* Dark mode styles */
}
```

1. Verify the `dark` class is being toggled on `<html>` element

2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Deployment Issues

### Build Succeeds Locally but Fails on Platform

**Symptoms:**

- `npm run build` works locally
- Deployment platform shows build errors

**Solutions:**

1. Check Node.js version matches:

```json
// package.json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.0.0"
}
```

1. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json` (not just `devDependencies`)

2. Check environment variables are set on platform

3. Review build logs for specific errors

### 404 Errors After Deployment

**Symptoms:**

- Homepage works but other pages show 404
- Links broken in production

**Solutions:**

1. **For GitHub Pages**, set base path:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://username.github.io',
  base: '/repo-name',
});
```

1. Verify all internal links are correct

2. Check that all referenced files exist

3. Configure redirects for SPA-like behavior

### Assets Not Loading

**Symptoms:**

- Images missing in production
- CSS not loading
- JavaScript errors

**Solutions:**

1. Verify assets are in correct directories:
   - `src/assets/` for optimized assets
