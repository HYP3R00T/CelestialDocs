Got questions? We've got answers! Here are the most common questions about CelestialDocs.

## Getting Started

### What is CelestialDocs?

CelestialDocs is a modern documentation template built with Astro. It provides a flexible navigation system, multi-collection support, and beautiful theming out of the box. Think of it as a ready-to-use foundation for creating professional documentation sites.

### Do I need to know Astro to use CelestialDocs?

Not necessarily! If you just want to write documentation, you only need to know Markdown. However, basic Astro knowledge is helpful if you want to customize components or layouts.

### Can I use CelestialDocs for my project?

Yes! CelestialDocs is open source and free to use for any project - personal, commercial, or open source.

### How is CelestialDocs different from other documentation tools?

CelestialDocs stands out with:

- **True multi-collection support** - Multiple documentation sets in one project
- **Flexible navigation** - Mix manual and auto-generated navigation
- **Tab-level organization** - Create distinct navigation contexts
- **Type-safe configuration** - Everything configured in TypeScript

## Installation & Setup

### What are the system requirements?

You need:

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git (optional but recommended)

### Can I use this with an existing Astro project?

CelestialDocs is designed as a standalone template. While you could integrate it into an existing project, it's easier to start fresh and migrate your content.

### How do I update CelestialDocs?

Since CelestialDocs is a template (not a package), updates require manual merging. Check the repository for updates and merge changes into your project. We recommend using Git to track your customizations.

### Can I deploy CelestialDocs for free?

Yes! You can deploy for free on:

- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare Pages

See our [Deployment Guide](/docs/advanced/deployment) for details.

## Content & Writing

### Should I use Markdown or MDX?

Use Markdown (`.md`) for simple documentation. Use MDX (`.mdx`) when you need to include custom components or interactive elements.

### How do I add images?

Place images in `src/assets/` or `public/` and reference them:

```markdown
<!-- Using assets (optimized) -->
![Alt text](../../assets/image.png)

<!-- Using public (not optimized) -->
![Alt text](/images/image.png)
```

### Can I use custom components in my docs?

Yes! Use MDX files and import your components:

```mdx
---
title: "My Page"
---

import MyComponent from '../../components/MyComponent.astro';

# My Page

<MyComponent />
```

See [Custom Components](/docs/advanced/custom-components) for details.

### How do I add code blocks with syntax highlighting?

Just use standard Markdown code fences with a language:

````markdown
```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```
````

### Can I hide a page from navigation?

Yes! Use the `navHidden` frontmatter field:

```markdown
---
title: "Hidden Page"
navHidden: true
---
```

## Navigation

### What's the difference between groups and tabs?

- **Groups** are sections in the sidebar that organize related pages
- **Tabs** are top-level navigation contexts that completely switch the sidebar content

Tabs are like different "modes" of navigation, while groups are sections within a mode.

### How do I create a new navigation group?

Add a group to `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION` in `data/config.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: "my-group",
  label: "My Group",
  icon: "🎯",
  autoGenerated: true,
}
```

### What's auto-generated navigation?

Auto-generated navigation automatically discovers and includes all files in a folder without you having to list them manually. Just set `autoGenerated: true` on a group.

### Can I mix manual and auto-generated entries?

Yes! This is called a hybrid group. List some entries manually, then set `autoGenerated: true` to include the rest:

```typescript
{
  id: "guides",
  label: "Guides",
  icon: "📖",
  entries: [
    { slug: "guides/overview" },  // Manual
    // Other files auto-generated
  ],
  autoGenerated: true,
}
```

See [Hybrid Groups](/docs/patterns/hybrid-groups) for details.

### How do I control the order of auto-generated pages?

Use the `order` field in frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "My Page"
order: 1
---
```

Lower numbers appear first. Pages without an order field are sorted alphabetically.

### Can I use custom icons in navigation?

Yes! You can use:

- **Emoji icons:** Just use the emoji character: `icon: "🚀"`
- **SVG icons:** Reference a file in `src/assets/icons/`: `icon: "document"`

## Configuration

### Where is everything configured?

Most configuration is in `data/config.ts`:

- `SITE` - Site metadata
- `CONTENT` - Content collections
- `HEADER_NAV_ITEMS` - Header navigation
- `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION` - Sidebar navigation

### How do I change the site title?

Edit the `SITE` object in `data/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const SITE: SiteConfig = {
  title: "My Documentation",
  // ...
};
```

### How do I add social links to the header?

Add them to `HEADER_SOCIAL_LINKS` in `data/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const HEADER_SOCIAL_LINKS: HeaderSocialLink[] = [
  {
    platform: "github",
    href: "https://github.com/yourusername",
  },
  {
    platform: "twitter",
    href: "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
  },
];
```

### Can I customize the theme colors?

Yes! Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize colors:

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: {
        500: '#your-color',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

See [Custom Styling](/docs/advanced/custom-styling) for details.

### How do I disable dark mode?

Dark mode is built into the theme. To disable it, you'd need to modify the theme toggle component and remove dark mode styles. We recommend keeping it - users love dark mode!

## Multiple Collections

### What are content collections?

Content collections are separate documentation sets within one project. For example, you might have a "docs" collection for user documentation and an "api" collection for API reference.

### How do I create a second collection?

1. Define it in `src/content.config.ts`
2. Add it to `CONTENT.systems` in `data/config.ts`
3. Add navigation in `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION`
4. Create the content folder

See [Two-Collection Layout](/docs/patterns/two-collection-layout) for a complete guide.

### Can I have more than two collections?

Yes! You can have as many collections as you need. Just follow the same pattern for each one.

### Can collections have different styles?

Yes! You can apply collection-specific styles using CSS:

```css
[data-collection="docs"] {
  --accent-color: blue;
}

[data-collection="api"] {
  --accent-color: green;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### My changes aren't showing up

Try:

1. Restart the dev server (`Ctrl+C`, then `npm run dev`)
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Check the terminal for error messages

### I'm getting TypeScript errors

Run `npm run check` to see all errors. Common issues:

- Missing required frontmatter fields (title, description)
- Invalid configuration in `data/config.ts`
- Incorrect file paths in navigation

### Navigation isn't working

Check:

- File paths match the slugs in your configuration
- Files have valid frontmatter with a title
- The group ID matches the folder name
- You've restarted the dev server after config changes

### Build fails

Common causes:

- TypeScript errors (run `npm run check`)
- Missing dependencies (run `npm install`)
- Invalid frontmatter in content files
- Broken internal links

See [Troubleshooting](/docs/help/troubleshooting) for more solutions.

### Dark mode looks broken

Ensure:

- CSS variables are defined for both light and dark modes
- The `dark` class is being toggled on the `<html>` element
- Tailwind's `darkMode: 'class'` is configured

## Performance

### How fast is CelestialDocs?

Very fast! Astro generates static HTML, so pages load instantly. The site is optimized for performance with:

- Static site generation
- Minimal JavaScript
- Optimized images
- Efficient CSS

### Can I add analytics?

Yes! Add your analytics script to the base layout. Most analytics services (Google Analytics, Plausible, Fathom) work great with static sites.

### Does it work offline?

The built site is static HTML, so pages work offline once loaded. You could add a service worker for full offline support.

## Customization

### Can I change the layout?

Yes! Layouts are in `src/layouts/`. You can modify existing layouts or create new ones.

### Can I add a blog?

CelestialDocs is focused on documentation, but you could add a blog collection following the same pattern as other collections.

### Can I use a different CSS framework?

CelestialDocs uses Tailwind CSS. You could replace it with another framework, but it would require significant refactoring.

### How do I add a custom landing page?

Create `src/pages/index.astro` with your custom content. See [Custom Landing Pages](/docs/patterns/custom-landing) for examples.

## Contributing

### Can I contribute to CelestialDocs?
