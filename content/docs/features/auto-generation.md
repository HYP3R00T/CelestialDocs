Auto-generated navigation is one of CelestialDocs' most powerful features. Instead of manually listing every page in your configuration, you can let the system automatically discover and include all files from a folder. This makes it incredibly easy to add new documentation pages without touching your configuration file.

## How It Works

When you mark a group as auto-generated, CelestialDocs will:

1. **Scan the folder** that matches the group ID
2. **Discover all `.md` and `.mdx` files** in that folder
3. **Sort them alphabetically** by filename
4. **Add them to the sidebar** automatically

The pages will use their frontmatter `title` as the sidebar label, or you can override this with `navLabel` in the frontmatter.

## Basic Configuration

To enable auto-generation for a group, simply add `autoGenerated: true` to the group configuration:

```typescript
{
  id: "features",
  label: "Features",
  icon: "✨",
  autoGenerated: true,
}
```

This tells CelestialDocs to automatically include all files from `content/docs/features/` in the sidebar.

## When to Use Auto-Generation

Auto-generation is perfect for:

- **Feature documentation** where alphabetical order works well
- **API reference pages** that don't need specific ordering
- **Large sections** with many pages that would be tedious to list manually
- **Growing sections** where you frequently add new pages

## When NOT to Use Auto-Generation

Manual configuration is better for:

- **Getting started guides** that need a specific learning order
- **Tutorials** with sequential steps
- **Sections with few pages** where you want precise control
- **Mixed content** where some pages should be hidden or reordered

## Controlling Page Appearance

Even with auto-generation, you have control over how pages appear:

### Custom Sidebar Label

Use `navLabel` in frontmatter to override the sidebar text:

```yaml
---
title: "Table of Contents Feature"
navLabel: "TOC"
---
```

### Custom Icon

Add an icon to individual pages:

```yaml
---
title: "Theme System"
navIcon: "🎨"
---
```

### Hide from Navigation

Hide specific pages from the auto-generated list:

```yaml
---
title: "Internal Documentation"
navHidden: true
---
```

## Hybrid Approach

You can combine manual entries with auto-generation! List specific pages first, then let auto-generation fill in the rest:

```typescript
{
  id: "features",
  label: "Features",
  icon: "✨",
  autoGenerated: true,
  entries: [
    // These appear first, in this order
    { slug: "features/overview" },
    { slug: "features/getting-started" },
    // Then all other files appear alphabetically
  ],
}
```

## File Naming Tips

Since auto-generated pages are sorted alphabetically, consider these naming strategies:

- **Prefix with numbers**: `01-introduction.md`, `02-setup.md`
- **Use descriptive names**: `auto-generation.md` sorts before `breadcrumbs.md`
- **Group related pages**: `theme-colors.md`, `theme-fonts.md`, `theme-layout.md`

## Example: This Documentation

The Features section you're reading right now uses auto-generation! Here's the actual configuration:

```typescript
{
  id: "features",
  label: "Features",
  icon: "✨",
  autoGenerated: true,
}
```

All the feature pages are automatically discovered and sorted alphabetically. When we add a new feature page, it appears in the sidebar automatically—no configuration changes needed!
