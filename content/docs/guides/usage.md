This guide explains the differences between plain Markdown (`.md`) and MDX (`.mdx`), and recommends when to use each:

- Markdown (`.md`): simple, fast, and sufficient for most documentation pages.
- MDX (`.mdx`): allows embedding React/interactive components — use only when you need components in content.

Recommendations for end users:

- Prefer `.md` for most pages to keep content simple.
- Use `.mdx` when you need to embed interactive widgets (advanced users).
