Each documentation page includes a "View as Markdown" button that serves the raw markdown/MDX file for viewing or download.

When to use it:

- To quickly copy content or view the original source.
- To inspect raw frontmatter or embedded markdown.

Notes:
- The raw content is served from `content/docs/<slug>.md` (or `.mdx`) via the provided API route.

<!-- TODO: add example and link to the download endpoint -->
