This page shows practical examples of grouping, manual entries, mixing auto-generated content, and how `navOrder` and `navHidden` affect the resulting sidebar.

## Example 1 — Basic auto-generated group

Given a folder with these files:

```
content/docs/guides/
├─ intro.md
├─ setup.md
├─ usage.md
```

With a simple group configuration:

```ts
{
  id: 'guides',
  label: 'Guides',
  autoGenerated: true,
}
```

Result: the `Guides` group will include `intro`, `setup`, and `usage` entries automatically (sorted by label unless `navOrder` is set in frontmatter).

## Example 2 — Pinning entries at top with `entries`

You may want to place key pages at the top of a group regardless of filesystem order. Add manual `entries` to the group in `data/config.ts`:

```ts
{
  id: 'guides',
  label: 'Guides',
  autoGenerated: true,
  entries: [
    { slug: 'guides/intro', label: 'Introduction' },
    { slug: 'guides/setup', label: 'Setup' },
  ],
}
```

Now `intro` and `setup` will appear first in that order, then the remaining auto-generated pages will be appended.

## Example 3 — Using `navOrder` to influence auto-generated entries

When auto-generated entries are appended, you can use `navOrder` in the page frontmatter to control relative ordering.

`content/docs/guides/usage.md`:

```yaml
---
title: "Usage"
pubDatetime: 2025-12-21T00:00:00Z
navOrder: 5
---
```

`content/docs/guides/advanced.md`:

```yaml
---
title: "Advanced"
pubDatetime: 2025-12-21T00:00:00Z
navOrder: 2
---
```

Lower `navOrder` values sort before higher numbers. If `navOrder` is omitted entries are sorted by label.

## Example 4 — Hiding pages from the sidebar

To keep a page accessible but not listed in the sidebar, set `navHidden: true` in the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Notes"
pubDatetime: 2025-12-21T00:00:00Z
navHidden: true
---
```

Hidden pages remain accessible via direct URL but are omitted from auto-generated lists and manual entries if the page isn't explicitly included.

## Example 5 — Fully manual group (no auto-generation)

If you prefer a curated list only, turn off auto-generation:

```ts
{
  id: 'tutorials',
  label: 'Tutorials',
  autoGenerated: false,
  entries: [
    { slug: 'tutorials/start', label: 'Start here' },
    { slug: 'tutorials/advanced', label: 'Advanced topics' },
  ],
}
```

This ensures only the specified entries are shown.

## Practical tips

- Use `autoGenerated: true` for large doc sets to avoid manual upkeep.
- Use manual `entries` to pin core pages and provide clearer labels.
- Use `navOrder` sparingly; prefer meaningful labels and only use ordering for a small number of items.
- Remember `navHidden` is useful for utility pages or in-progress drafts.
