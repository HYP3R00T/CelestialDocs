This example walks you through adding a new guide to the site and ensuring it appears where you expect in the sidebar.

## 1) Create the file

Create a new Markdown file under `content/docs/guides/`, for example:

```
content/docs/guides/my-new-guide.md
```

Add required frontmatter (at minimum `title`; date fields like `pubDatetime` are optional):

```yaml
---
title: "My New Guide"
description: "Short summary of what this guide covers."
---
```

Write your content below the frontmatter using standard Markdown. Keep headings semantic (use H2/H3) so the Table of Contents picks them up.

## 2) Control where it appears in the sidebar

By default, pages under `content/docs/guides/` will be auto-generated into the `guides` group (if the group is configured with `autoGenerated: true`). If you want to customize how the page appears, add these optional frontmatter fields:

- `navLabel` — change the text shown in the sidebar
- `navIcon` — emoji or icon name to display next to the entry
- `navHidden` — set to `true` to keep the page accessible by URL but hide it from the sidebar

Example with sidebar options:

```yaml
---
title: "My New Guide"
description: "Short summary of what this guide covers."
pubDatetime: 2025-12-21T00:00:00Z
navLabel: "Quick Guide"
navIcon: "📘"
---
```

If you prefer to pin the page to the top of the group regardless of folder order, add a manual entry in `data/config.ts` under `SIDEBAR_NAVIGATION.groups[].entries`:

```ts
{ slug: 'guides/my-new-guide', label: 'Quick Guide', icon: 'book' }
```

## 3) Commit, push, and verify

1. Commit your file to a branch in your fork and push it to GitHub.
2. Start the dev server locally (`pnpm dev`) or deploy your branch to preview if you have CI set up.
3. Visit the docs and verify the page appears in the `Guides` group and that the label/icon ordering reflects your frontmatter or manual config.

## 4) Troubleshooting

- Page not showing: check the file path and slug; ensure `navHidden` is not set to `true`.
- Manual entry warning: if you add a manual slug in `data/config.ts` and see a warning, verify the slug is correct and the file exists.
- Ordering surprises: remember manual `entries` control top ordering.

## 5) Optional: Add image assets and meta info

Place images in `public/images/` and reference them by path (e.g., `/images/guides/cover.jpg`). Include descriptive alt text in the page content or frontmatter for accessibility.

## Example final file

```md
---
title: "My New Guide"
description: "How to use X to Y"
navLabel: "Quick Guide"
navIcon: "📘"
---

If you'd like, I can add a screenshot showing the page in the sidebar, or add a short GIF demonstrating the workflow.
